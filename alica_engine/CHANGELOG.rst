  ---------
  Co-authored-by: Rogerio Fonteles <rogerio.fonteles@moley.com>
* Logging fixes (`#496 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/496>`_)
  * Logging fixes
  - Make AlicaDefaultLogger thread safe since it is the responsibility of
  the logging implementation
  - Set the logger immediately on construction of the context so that it
  can be used to log messages during construction & before init() is
  called. This solves some obsure bugs where the logger was used before
  it was initialized in the context's set api's eg. setTraceFactory or the
  trace factory'sconstructor etc.
  - Provides the ability to set the logger multiple times before the
  context is initialized which is consistent with other set api's
  - Destroy the logger when the context is destroyed
  - Add tests for custom logging & fix the test for default logging
  * Fix compile error in supplementary tests
* Remove eventDriven & deferring of behaviours (`#494 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/494>`_)
  eventDriven is removed because:
  - there is no use case for this functionality so far
  - external code cannot possibly hold a reference to a behaviour because
  there is no such external API & even if such a reference is obtained
  it can be invalidated at anytime because the behaviour can be destroyed
  at any time & therefore triggering the  behaviour in the current way
  will likely lead to crashes
  - the functionality of eventDriven can be replicated by having
  a state machine with 2 states (A & B) & a transition. The transition
  will be true when the trigger condition is true & the code that needs to
  be executed (i.e. the code that was in run() method earlier) will now
  be in the init method of B
  deferring is removed because:
  - there is no use case for this functionality so far
  - it is not currently implemented
  - there is no easy way to implement it either
  - same functionality can be had by having an additional state that
  waits for the deferring period before transitioning to the state with
  the attached behaviour

  * Fix mapping
* Improve type determination in blackboard impl (`#479 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/479>`_)
  * Improve type determination in blackboard impl
  The type determination method used to default construct a value of the
  given type which meant that -
  1. an unnecessary object would be created just for determining the type
  which could potentially be a costly operation that could have side
  effects depending on the type stored
  2. the default constructor might not be available, so such types would
  not be able to be stored on the blackboard
  3. a variant was constructed from the value & the type determined using
  the variant index. This is a potentially confusing operation because
  the type determination relies on the variant implementation.
  To overcome this, the type is determined at compile time following
  clear steps to determine supported type conversions:
  - ints are promoted to int64 (already existed)
  - uints are promoted to uint64 (already existed)
  - floats are promoted to double (indirectly supported earlier, but
  explicitly added now)
  - the promoted type is then checked to see if it is present in the
  variant types at compile time
  - if not found, the type is treated as std::any

* Remove legacy transitions (`#455 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/455>`_)
  remove LegacyTransitionConditions
* Cleanup debug logs in constraint queries (`#459 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/459>`_)
* Add ability to find config files in multiple dirs (`#429 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/429>`_)
  * Add ability to find config files in multiple dirs
  - The engine now has a set of directories where it looks for config
  files recursively
  - If the roleset with the given file name is not found (recursive
  search), then the engine looks for any roleset file in the specified
  directories but not recursively
  - The beh & cnd files are now referred to only by their file name &
  not by their relative path to the plans folder
  - The plan, role & task config keys are no longer required since the
  search is recursive & hence these are removed
  * Accept multiple config folders in the AlicaContext
  * Consider only the file name in referenced elements
  If the referenced element has a path instead of a name only consider the
  name Eg. if a behaviour is referenced by a path (relative or absolute)
  to the .beh file then only consider the file name since we perform
  a search for the file now instead of directly using the path.
  * Fix tests
  * Fix turtlesim
  * Review comments: Change unordered_set to vector
  For config paths container, use vector instead of unordered_set so that
  user order can be maintained. In this case, the search for files will
  proceed from index 0 which means that will also be the order of priority
  to find files.
  Couple of other very minor fixes

  * Use set API for mapping from src to target blackboard
  This implies the same kind of type conversions are supported by mapping
  & set API. This additionally avoids the need to suppress warnings in the
  make variant helper & prevents conversions between type categories i.e.
  bool -> double, int -> double etc. but supports conversions within the
  same type category eg. int8_t -> int64_t, float -> double etc
  * Add support for unsigned integer types

* Removing AlicaEngine::this from TeamObserver (`#282 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/282>`_)
  Removing AlicaEngine references from TeamObserver and subclasses. Delay initialization of the engine in tests.
* Add configurable auto failure handling capability (`#279 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/279>`_)
  * Add configurable auto failure handling capability
  Add a AutoFailureHandling config that can be used to enable/disable
  auto failure handling for a plan in the engine
  * Add config to all alica.yaml files
  * Enable plan abort & make tests more robust
  The plan abort rule should not be considered an auto failure handling
  behaviour so that the failure can be immediately handled by the higher
  levels.
  Some of the tests could pass if a plan restarted when they should fail,
  this is suitably addressed by ensuring transitions are unset when they
  are no longer needed to be enabled & by ensuring the plan init is only
  executed once
* Fix alica tests (`#275 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/275>`_)

* Fix double locking of fast path events mutex (`#267 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/267>`_)
  While processing fast path events the PlanBase thread can activate
  plans & behaviours on a RunningPlan. Activation involves calling init
  & run (first call only) which now happen on the same thread. init/run
  can set success/failure which adds more fast path events. Therefore
  the fast path event mutex can be locked twice. This change avoids the
  double locking by making a copy of the fast past events before
  processing them.

  * Check if trace factory is setting before using it
  * Set basicplan name
  * Bug fixes
  - check if basic plan exists before accessing the trace context
  - if no parent is found create a root trace
  - remove hack to create basic plan
  * Fix alica engine termination
  Do the following in order to correctly terminate the engine:
  1. Stop the plan base thread. This prevents any more changes to the
  running plan.
  2. Deactivate the running plan in plan base stop(). This ensures the
  plans/behaviours are scheduled for termination in the correct order.
  3. Stop all behaviours & plans that may be running. There should not
  be any since (2) ensures this taken care of
  4. Execute all pending non repeatable jobs in the scheduler thread.
  This ensures the plan/behaviour init/terminates are actually executed.
  5. Stop the scheduler thread
  Add a trace log that indicates if the trace is for a behaviour or a
  plan.
  Note: the master plan trace is not reported because the master plan does
  not have a corresponding basic plan attached to it. This is a bug &
  the reason for it is because there is no ConfAbstractPlanWrapper for the
  master plan due to which it is not in the plan pool. This has to be fixed
  in a separate PR.
  * Bring back scheduler null check in engine terminate
  * Avoid unused variable warning
  * Create BasicPlan object for the master plan
  There is no ConfAbstractPlanWrapper corresponding to the master plan.
  Therefore get the master plan details by calling getPlans() on the
  PlanRepository which includes the master plan details.
  * Fix ci

* Track RunningPlan in beh, plan's exec context + optimize (`#174 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/174>`_)
  The running plan under which the behaviour or plan is executing was not
  tracked (execution context). Instead only the running plan under which
  the behaviour or plan was started i.e. signal context was tracked. This
  meant that it was possible for the behaviour to access a destroyed
  running plan object.
  Optimization: Skip calling init/terminate when the behaviour/plan's
  execution is out of context with the signal from the main thread.
  Improve comments
* Bas beh sched engine (`#147 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/147>`_)
  Plan init/run/terminate + plan/behaviour scheduling + web based designer
  1. Introduce init, run, terminate functionality for plans (analogous to their counterparts for behaviours)
  2. Introduce ordered scheduling of plan & behaviour init, run & terminate methods. The engine now provides the following guarantees:
  a. The init method of the parent plan will be executed before the init of any of its child plans/behaviours
  b. The run method of the plan/behaviour will be executed after the init of that plan/behaviour (was also the case earlier) & the terminate will execute after the run/init method is executed. From a user's perspective, the engine does not guarantee that the run will be called (for eg. run could be skipped if the behaviour is terminated immediately), however the current implementation does.
  c. The terminate of the child plans/behaviours will be executed before the terminate of the parent plan
  d. When a transition is made from state A to state B, terminate for all plans/behaviours in state A will be called before calling init for all plans/behaviours in state B
  e. The init & terminate for plans/behaviours in a single state will be executed sequentially but no order is guaranteed. This implies that it is not possible for init/terminates to run in parallel
  These guarantees are enforced through scheduling the inits & terminates on a single scheduler thread. The run method is scheduled by the init & the terminate waits for the run to complete.
  3. The engine uses a multithreaded timer pool to execute the run methods, so run's can be executed in parallel as before. The timer pool is taken an a parameter to the engine so users are free to provide any implementation. The default implementation is the one in alica-supplementary that is based on ros. This also means that there is no separate thread for each behaviour as was the case earlier, thereby dramatically reducing the number of threads used by the engine
  4. The engine is now compatible with the new plan designer. The plan layouts in alica_tests are done in the new web based plan designer & the code is regenerated as per the new code generation which generates the init/run/terminate for plans

* Fix several race conditions in BasicBehaviour
  Since several flag variables like _started, _callInit, _success, _failure
  & _running are accessed & modified by both the calling thread (ALICA main
  plan base thread) & the behaviour thread, it can lead to several race
  conditions & synchronization issues which are fixed in this commit:
  1. Problem: behaviour thread can wait on condition variable even after
  receving start signal as the main thread does not modify _running under
  the _runLoopMutex.
  Solution: use the _runLoopMutex whenever modifying the signal state.
  2. Problem: isSuccess() & isFailure() can both return true at same time
  & _failure, _success can cause race conditions due to no mutex/atomic protection.
  Solution: maintain behaviour result status in atomic enum variable
  which can be in unknown, failure or success state, not both.
  3. Problem: If behaviour is stopped & started in quick succession, the
  stop may never been seen leading to onTermination() not being called.
  Solution: Maintain behaviour state, signal state & if stop was called
  while behaviour is running user code. Call onTermination() every time
  behaviour is stopped.
  4. Problem: behaviour can set success or failure in initialiseParameters().
  Solution: behaviour can set success or failure only in run().
  5. Cleanup code flow especially for triggered behaviour. Behaviour waits
  to receive start signal, then moves to run state (where it waits for trigger
  /stop in case of triggered behaviour). Then it terminates when stop is called.

  Provide api in AlicaContext to use a custom clock
* Provide api in AlicaContext to use a custom clock
  A custom clock is useful for simulations & testing in order to control the
  speed of the simulation. This clock can be set in the AlicaContext and will
  be used by the engine for time-based work.
* Merge pull request `#80 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/80>`_ from rapyuta-robotics/ctx_is_state_active
  Change getCurrentState() api to isStateActive() in AlicaContext
* Make isStateActiveHelper() a static method of AlicaContext
  Make isStateActiveHelper() a static method of AlicaContext instead of
  a standalone function to improve code structure.
* Change getCurrentState() api to isStateActive() in AlicaContext
  getCurrentState() returns only the active state in the deepest alica plan
  tree node. Other active states cannot be known using this method. Therefore
  change the api to isStateActive() which can check if a given state is active
  in the entire current plan tree.
