# The ALICA Designer runtime

## 1 How to start the plan designer?

- To run the designer, use the shell script in
supplementary/alica_designer_runtime/:

```
    ./run_designer.sh [start|reset|update]
        start - (optional) starts the designer backend + UI
        reset - clear the database
        update - pull newer images
```
Launch time configurations can be changed at `config.env`

- The designer is web based & runs in the browser. After executing the above command,
navigate to http://localhost:3030/ to run the designer.
- When you start the plan designer for the first time, it should look like this:

### 2.3 Login button

Pressing the login button will open the login page of the plan designer.

![login_page](./doc/login_page.png)

At the center of the page you can see the "Login Via Github" button. If you have not used the plan designer
with your GitHub account yet, you will be asked to give permissions to the plan designer to
access your repositories. This is necessary for the GitHub import and export feature of the plan designer.

After logging in, the login button will be replaced with your GitHub username.

### 2.4 Create alica elements menu

In the top right corner of the plan designer sits a menu for creating plans and other elements.
Selecting an element (for example Plan) will open up a menu for creating that element. Pressing "More"
will open up the menu and reveal the options to create Tasks and Roles.

![create_menu](./doc/create_menu.png)

You can create the following elements:

- Plan
- Behaviour
- Plan Type
- Configuration
- Task & Task Repository
- Role & Role Repository
- Conditions

#### 2.4.1 Plan
![create_plan](./doc/create_plan.png)

- Utility Threshold: A utility of an assignment needs an increase of at least the threshold value
compared to the current assignment's utility before the assignment of an agent is replaced.
- Frequency: Sets the number of executions of the plan's run method per second.
- Master Plan: Check that box if you want to use the plan as a Master Plan for your agent.

#### 2.4.2 Behaviour
![create_behaviour](./doc/create_behaviour.png)
- Event Driven: Check that box if you prefer to execute the run method of the behaviour manually
instead of executing it with a fixed frequency per second.
- Frequency: Sets the number of executions of the behaviour's run method per second.
- Deferring: Initial delay in ms before executing the behaviours run method the first time.

#### 2.4.2 Task & TaskRepository
![create_task](./doc/create_task.png)

- Task Repository: Select the repository in which the new task should be stored.

You can create a TaskRepository by switching the tab from "Task" to "Task Repository".

![setup_blackboard](./doc/setup_blackboard.png)

### 2.7 Create Plan Space

The plan designer has an empty space in which you can create your plans. Selecting a plan in the
selection menu will show the structure of the plan in the plan space.

On the left side of the plan designer you can see a list of tools you can use to create your plan.

![plan_creation_tools](./doc/plan_creation_tools.png)

From top to bottom these tools are:
  - Selection Tool
  - Entry Point Tool
  - State Tool
  - Success State Tool
  - Failure State Tool
  - Synchronization Tool
  - Transition Synchronization Tool

### 2.7.1 Entry Points
Select the entry point tool symbol and click somewhere in the plan space. This will open a
window for creating your entry point.

![plan_creation_tools](./doc/create_entry_point.png)

You can either select a task or create a new one.

After creating the entry point it will be visible in the plan space. You can select it
with the selection tool and adjust its properties in the properties tab.

To learn more about entry points have a look at the
[documentation](https://rapyuta-robotics.github.io/alica/articles/entrypoints.html).

### 2.7.2 States

You can place states by selecting either the state, failure state or success state tool.
Then click somewhere in the plan space to place your state. Select the state with the
selection tool to open the properties tab of the state.

To learn more about states have a look at the
[documentation](https://rapyuta-robotics.github.io/alica/articles/finite-state_machines.html).

### 2.7.3 Transitions

Choose the selection tool and hover with your cursor on the source state / entry point.
Move your cursor to the circle appearing at the top of the state / entry point. Drag and
drop your cursor to your destination node. Wait with dropping until a circle appears on top
of your destination node and drop in the middle of that circle.

By default, the condition "Default Condition" will be attached to the transition. You can select a condition in the selection menu and attach it to a transition with drag & drop.

Click on a transition with the selection tool to adjust properties and blackboard
of a transition. A connection from an entry point to a state does not have a transition condition.

![transition_condition](./doc/transition_condition.png)

If a transition condition has a red grid, it means that the blackboard items of the condition are not fully mapped. By clicking on the red grid, you can setup the key mapping between the condition and the current plan.

![keymapping](./doc/keymapping.png)

To learn more about transitions have a look at the
[documentation](https://rapyuta-robotics.github.io/alica/articles/finite-state_machines.html).

### 2.7.4 Synchronization

Select the synchronization tool and place a synchronization node in the plan space.
Select the transition synchronization tool and place it in the plan space.

Connect the synchronization node with the transition synchronization node.

You can synchronize transitions by creating a connection from the source node to the
transition synchronization node. Then create a transition from the transition synchronization
node to the target node.

To learn more about synchronization, have a look at the
[documentation](https://rapyuta-robotics.github.io/alica/articles/synchronisations.html).

![synchronization](./doc/synchronization.png)

### 2.7.5 Add behaviours, configurations, plan types and plans

To add a behaviour / configuration / plan type / plan to a state, drag and drop it from
the selection menu to a state of your choice.

### 2.7.6 Delete parts of your plan

You can delete parts of your plan by selecting the node / transition with the selection
tool and hitting the delete key on your keyboard.

You can remove behaviours / configurations / plan types / plans from a state by hovering
over the element you want to remove and clicking on the "X".

## 3 How to import and export plans?

The plan designer supports three ways of importing and exporting plans:
- Using native filesystem (only with NATIVE_MODE)
- Using zip files
- Using a GitHub repository

### 3.1 FileSystem-Workflow

The web-plan-designer provides the capability to import and export plans directly from and to the local filesystem on the host where the web designer is running.

To do this, the following environment variables must be set at launch time
- `NATIVE_MODE` must be set to `true`. [See here](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/blob/7ca145e25647a3a65a6e624c0ab8786d15198cf3/supplementary/alica_designer_runtime/config.env#L8)
- `NATIVE_IMPORT_EXPORT_PATH` should be set to the filesystem path where the import/export takes place [See here](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/blob/7ca145e25647a3a65a6e624c0ab8786d15198cf3/supplementary/alica_designer_runtime/config.env#L11)

#### 3.1.1 Export
Simply click on the ‘+’ button in the top left corner of the page, and then click on File System -> Export

![import_export_fs](./doc/import_export_fs.png)

This will export the plans directly to the host's filesystem.

#### 3.1.2 Import
Same as export, but click on File System -> Import. This will import plans directly from the host's filesystem.

On successful import the plans should be visible in the right panel.

### 3.2 Zip-Workflow

The web-plan-designer provides the capability to export
your plans to a zip file, and also import plans from a zip file.

#### 3.2.1 Export
Simply click on the ‘+’ button in the top left corner of the page, and then click on Zip -> Export to Zip.

![import_export_zip](./doc/import_export_zip.png)

This will trigger a download of a zip file "web_designer_program.zip".
The zip file contains information about your created plans.

To use your alica plans in your project you have to
 - Extract the content of the zip file
 - Replace the content of your projects etc/ folder with the plans,
roles and tasks folder in web_designer_program/alica_program/

#### 3.2.2 Import
Same as export, but click on Zip -> Import from Zip, and select a zip file from your computer containing valid ALICA plan elements,
to import them to the web-designer. Usually this will be a zip file of your etc/ folder.

<span style="color:red">WARNING</span>: Import <span style="color:red">overwrites</span> anything
you’ve done on the web-designer, so make sure to export first, to save your data.

On successful import the plans should be visible in the right panel.

### 3.3 Git-Workflow
It is also possible to import plans from a remote GitHub repository,
as well as push changes back to the same repo, or any other, if explicitly specified.

To be able to use this, you first need to log in to your GitHub account from the
web-plan-designer. Use the Login button (see first image in this readme).
If you have not used the plan designer before, the application asks for access rights.

After logging in via GitHub you should be able to see additional options.

![import_export_git](./doc/import_export_git.png)

#### 3.3.0 Setup

To be able to login to github and use the Git-workflow to import and export plan, it is necessary to register the web-plan-designer application as an oauth2 client with github before launching the web-plan-designer.

1. Follow [Github's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to create a new oauth application. Enter the URL of the plan designer (default: `http://localhost:3030/`) as the 'Homepage URL' and 'Authorization Callback URL'.

![oauth_register](./doc/oauth_register.png)

2. Note down the client ID and client secret after registering the application in the previous step.

![oauth_creds](./doc/oauth_creds.png)

3. Set the client ID and client secret as environment variables before launching the web-plan-designer

```
    export SOCIAL_APP_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
    export SOCIAL_APP_SECRET=<client_secret
```
This can also be set in `config.env`

4. Set the client ID in the web-plan-designer [settings](#21-settings) after launch

![oauth_settings](./doc/oauth_settings.png)


#### 3.3.1 Import

Click on ‘Github -> Git Import’, and you’ll see the following form.

![import_git](./doc/import_git.png)

URL: Enter the git clone URL in https format only, ssh won’t work.

Branch Name: You can also enter a branch name, if kept blank, remote’s default will be used.

Plans Path: It is also recommended to provide the path to the plan elements (relative to repo root), in case your repo contains many different folders each organising an ALICA designer project.

E.g.  If your plans are in the `di_core`-repo , then the path for plans would be `robot/lbc/etc`, since that’s where the plans are located remotely.

NOTE: If the repository contains duplicate plans, but in different sub paths of the repo, providing Plans Path is necessary or else, the import process will fail.

After a successful git-import the plans should be visible in the right panel as below. Here lbc plans have been downloaded as an example.

![import_suc](./doc/import_suc.png)

#### 3.3.2 Export

In the top left corner  ‘+’ -> GitHub -> Git Export
The following form will pop up:

![export_git](./doc/export_git.png)

URL: Type in a git clone URL (https only).
URL can be left blank only if there was a previous import operation, in which case the git URL provided then will be used.

Target Branch Name: The branch to export to. If exists, it is used as the base branch for creating new commit, else 'Base Branch' (see below) is used. If left blank, a unique branch name will be decided by the backend.

Base Branch Name: Base branch on which new commit is made. Specify if exporting to a new branch. If left blank - Default branch of the repository will be used, unless 'Target Branch' exists.

Commit Message: Optional commit msg

Plans Path: The exact path (relative to repo root) where you want the plans to be available in the newly created branch after export.
If kept empty there are two possibilities for Plans Path:
Same as the Plans Path in the previous import operation.
If there was not any previous import operation the plans will be available inside the ‘plan_elems’ folder in repo root.

## 4 Code-Generation

If you already had git-lfs while cloning the repo:

`$ ./generate.sh <path_to_folder_that_contains_etc>`

If not, please install git-lfs (sudo apt-get install git-lfs) or https://git-lfs.github.com/ and run
`$ git-lfs pull`
`$ ./generate.sh <path_to_folder_that_contains_etc>`

The source code generated by the script can be found in
<path_to_folder_that_contains_etc>/Expr.
