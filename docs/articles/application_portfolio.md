| Robotic Soccer         | The team [Carpe Noctem Cassel](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/carpe-noctem-cassel) utilised ALICA as their central team strategy and coordination tool in the [RoboCup Middle Size League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/6) from 2009 until the team retired in 2017. |
| Robotic Space Missions | ALICA coordinated the extra-terrestrial exploration of several heterogeneous robots during the research project [IMPERA](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/vs/research/previous/impera.html) (2011-2014). |
|                        | The [Distributed System Research Group](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/vs/) participated at the [DLR Space Bot Cup](https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/vs/research/previous/spacebotcup.html) and utilised ALICA as their behaviour modelling tool for the competition in 2015. |
| Autonomous Driving     | [VW Research](https://www.volkswagen-karriere.de/en/working-at-volkswagen/corporate-divisions/research-development.html) commissioned a research study for applying the ALICA Framework to the domain of cooperative autonomous driving in 2014. |
|                        | A student team, supported by the [Distributed System Research Group](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/vs/), utilised ALICA as their behaviour modelling tool for the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup in 2015. |
| Warehouse Automation   | [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/) coordinates their picking assistant robots with ALICA in various customer warehouses since 2019. |
