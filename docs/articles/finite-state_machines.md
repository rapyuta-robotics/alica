# Finite-State Machines

In this article, we only explain the specifics about finite-state machines in the ALICA language. Hence, we expect the reader to have a basic understanding of [finite-state machines in general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).

In the ALICA language, a finite-state machine (FSM) is comprised of a set of states that are connected by directed transitions. All states in an FSM of ALICA are at least weakly connected with each other, hence, FSMs in ALICA form a [weakly connected directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Types_of_graphs).

## States

The ALICA language distinguishes between normal states and terminal states. Normal states may contain an arbitrary number of [behaviours](behaviours.md), [plans](plans.md), and [plantypes](plantypes.md). When an agent enters a normal state, it tries to execute all elements in it. Terminal states must be empty and may have an annotated [postcondition](conditions.md). Further, terminal states are distinguished into success and failure states. 

## Transitions

Transitions are directed connections between states. At most two transitions between a pair of states (A,B) may exist: One from state A to state B (A -> B) and one from state B to state A (B -> A). Further, transitions always have an annotated [precondition](conditions.md) and cannot start and end at the same state. Finally, no outgoing transitions may be attached to terminal states.

## Execution of Finite-State Machines

An agent in one state automatically enters another state, if the [precondition](conditions.md) of the connecting transition holds. If the preconditions of multiple transitions hold at the same time, only one transition is chosen. When an agent enters a failure/success state the FSM failed/succeeded for that agent and, if present, the annotated [postcondition](conditions.md) of that terminal state is considered to hold.

A FSM can be executed by multiple agents at the same time. In that case, each agent is informing all other agents about its current state in the FSM.

### Example: Cleaning Up

![FSM Example: Cleaning Up](../images/fsm_example.svg)
*Figure 1: FSM Example for Cleaning Up Items in a Household*

Let us go through the example in Figure 1. In FSM in this figure lets your service robot clean up an item by putting it were it belongs. In this example, each normal states (Z0-Z3) includes a single behaviour (orange boxes). The preconditions of the transitions are written aside of them. An agent in State Z0, for example, may go to State Z1, if it has *arrived* at its destination. 

The usual workflow in this example is that an agent is:

1. driving to the location of the item (Z0)
2. picks up the item (Z1)
3. if the agent is to far away from the item's destination, it transports the item to its destination (Z2)
4. places the item at its destination (Z3)

If the item is placed back correctly, the agent enters the success state and thereby signals its successful execution of the FSM. During this workflow, the item might be dropped accidentally, in which case the agent goes back to State Z1 and picks it up once again.

Now with this example in mind, you can see that states describe what an agent should do, while transitions are passed when certain goals are achieved. **Please note:** This semantics is slightly different from normal FSM semantics, where states typically describe states of the world and another state is reached by executing an action attached to a transition. 

Finally, the core concepts of [tasks](tasks.md), [entrypoints](entrypoints.md), [plans](plans.md), and [plan hierarchies](plan_hierarchies.md) are closely related to FSM as well, but they are explained in their own articles for keeping each article short.
