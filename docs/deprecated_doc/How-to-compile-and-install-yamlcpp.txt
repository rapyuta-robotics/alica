*** With CMake ***

yaml-cpp uses CMake to support cross-platform building. In a UNIX-like system, the basic steps to build are:

1. Download and install CMake (if you don't have root privileges, just install to a local directory, like ~/bin)

2. From the source directory, run:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON

and then the usual

make
sudo make install
