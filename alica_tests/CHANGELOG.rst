  * increase number of steps
  * log callCounter and expected runs
  * log times
  * initialize counter
  * remove logs
* Logging fixes (`#496 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/496>`_)
  * Logging fixes
  - Make AlicaDefaultLogger thread safe since it is the responsibility of
  the logging implementation
  - Set the logger immediately on construction of the context so that it
  can be used to log messages during construction & before init() is
  called. This solves some obsure bugs where the logger was used before
  it was initialized in the context's set api's eg. setTraceFactory or the
  trace factory'sconstructor etc.
  - Provides the ability to set the logger multiple times before the
  context is initialized which is consistent with other set api's
  - Destroy the logger when the context is destroyed
  - Add tests for custom logging & fix the test for default logging
  * Fix compile error in supplementary tests
* Replace world model test with global bb test (`#495 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/495>`_)
* Remove eventDriven & deferring of behaviours (`#494 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/494>`_)
  eventDriven is removed because:
  - there is no use case for this functionality so far
  - external code cannot possibly hold a reference to a behaviour because
  there is no such external API & even if such a reference is obtained
  it can be invalidated at anytime because the behaviour can be destroyed
  at any time & therefore triggering the  behaviour in the current way
  will likely lead to crashes
  - the functionality of eventDriven can be replicated by having
  a state machine with 2 states (A & B) & a transition. The transition
  will be true when the trigger condition is true & the code that needs to
  be executed (i.e. the code that was in run() method earlier) will now
  be in the init method of B
  deferring is removed because:
  - there is no use case for this functionality so far
  - it is not currently implemented
  - there is no easy way to implement it either
  - same functionality can be had by having an additional state that
  waits for the deferring period before transitioning to the state with
  the attached behaviour
* Add support for running the same plan / behaviour in the same state multiple times (`#487 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/487>`_)
  * pass confAbstractPlanWrapper to engine
  * use keymapping from conf abstract plan wrapper
  * add tests for running the same plans / behaviours multiple times in the same state
  * remove old code
  * assert _wrapper != nullptr before accessing keyMapping
  * remove old code
  * add and fix tests
  * add test for running plans & behs in parallel
  * move tests to SameInParallelTestPlan
  * use make_shared instead of new for creating RunningPlan
  * dont initialize runnableObjects with nullptr

* Removing AlicaEngine::this from TeamObserver (`#282 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/282>`_)
  Removing AlicaEngine references from TeamObserver and subclasses. Delay initialization of the engine in tests.
* Add configurable auto failure handling capability (`#279 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/279>`_)
  * Add configurable auto failure handling capability
  Add a AutoFailureHandling config that can be used to enable/disable
  auto failure handling for a plan in the engine
  * Add config to all alica.yaml files
  * Enable plan abort & make tests more robust
  The plan abort rule should not be considered an auto failure handling
  behaviour so that the failure can be immediately handled by the higher
  levels.
  Some of the tests could pass if a plan restarted when they should fail,
  this is suitably addressed by ensuring transitions are unset when they
  are no longer needed to be enabled & by ensuring the plan init is only
  executed once

  under <package>/essentials/ directory.
  2. Modify cmake files for above packages to additionally install these
  moved headers to the global include/ directory in addition to
  /include/essentials/ directory. This is to avoid breaking existing
  code and should be removed once the code is modified to include the
  headers using essentials/<header>. Also export these headers to avoid
  breaking existing code & build.
  * Rectify header folder structure
  Move header files (not sub-directories) in constraintsolver/include/
  under constraintsolver/include/constraintsolver/. However, to avoid
  breaking existing code, export these headers & install them
  under global include/ in addition to include/constraintsolver/.

  * add name to basicPlan, use name for tag
  * remove member variable and constructors
  * destroy traces after setting terminate tag
  * add comment to getTraceFactory method

  * Fixes in creating traces
  - Create traces in the execution context during init.
  - Provide the option to enable/disable tracing
  * Check if trace factory is setting before using it
  * Set basicplan name
  * Bug fixes
  - check if basic plan exists before accessing the trace context
  - if no parent is found create a root trace
  - remove hack to create basic plan
  * Fix alica engine termination
  Do the following in order to correctly terminate the engine:
  1. Stop the plan base thread. This prevents any more changes to the
  running plan.
  2. Deactivate the running plan in plan base stop(). This ensures the
  plans/behaviours are scheduled for termination in the correct order.
  3. Stop all behaviours & plans that may be running. There should not
  be any since (2) ensures this taken care of
  4. Execute all pending non repeatable jobs in the scheduler thread.
  This ensures the plan/behaviour init/terminates are actually executed.
  5. Stop the scheduler thread
  Add a trace log that indicates if the trace is for a behaviour or a
  plan.
  Note: the master plan trace is not reported because the master plan does
  not have a corresponding basic plan attached to it. This is a bug &
  the reason for it is because there is no ConfAbstractPlanWrapper for the
  master plan due to which it is not in the plan pool. This has to be fixed
  in a separate PR.
  * Bring back scheduler null check in engine terminate
  * Avoid unused variable warning
  * Create BasicPlan object for the master plan
  There is no ConfAbstractPlanWrapper corresponding to the master plan.
  Therefore get the master plan details by calling getPlans() on the
  PlanRepository which includes the master plan details.
  * Fix ci

* Bas beh sched engine (`#147 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/alica/issues/147>`_)
  Plan init/run/terminate + plan/behaviour scheduling + web based designer
  1. Introduce init, run, terminate functionality for plans (analogous to their counterparts for behaviours)
  2. Introduce ordered scheduling of plan & behaviour init, run & terminate methods. The engine now provides the following guarantees:
  a. The init method of the parent plan will be executed before the init of any of its child plans/behaviours
  b. The run method of the plan/behaviour will be executed after the init of that plan/behaviour (was also the case earlier) & the terminate will execute after the run/init method is executed. From a user's perspective, the engine does not guarantee that the run will be called (for eg. run could be skipped if the behaviour is terminated immediately), however the current implementation does.
  c. The terminate of the child plans/behaviours will be executed before the terminate of the parent plan
  d. When a transition is made from state A to state B, terminate for all plans/behaviours in state A will be called before calling init for all plans/behaviours in state B
  e. The init & terminate for plans/behaviours in a single state will be executed sequentially but no order is guaranteed. This implies that it is not possible for init/terminates to run in parallel
  These guarantees are enforced through scheduling the inits & terminates on a single scheduler thread. The run method is scheduled by the init & the terminate waits for the run to complete.
  3. The engine uses a multithreaded timer pool to execute the run methods, so run's can be executed in parallel as before. The timer pool is taken an a parameter to the engine so users are free to provide any implementation. The default implementation is the one in alica-supplementary that is based on ros. This also means that there is no separate thread for each behaviour as was the case earlier, thereby dramatically reducing the number of threads used by the engine
  4. The engine is now compatible with the new plan designer. The plan layouts in alica_tests are done in the new web based plan designer & the code is regenerated as per the new code generation which generates the init/run/terminate for plans
